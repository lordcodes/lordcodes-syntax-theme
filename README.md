# LordCodes Syntax - A code colour theme 🖍 ⌨️

Here I store the code theme I use in a variety of formats.

1. Android Studio / IntelliJ
2. Xcode

The theme is designed for 'dark' interfaces, starting from the base of the default dark themes for each tool. Each colour was chosen to have an appropriate level of constrast for accessibility and readability.

Please feel free to use the theme if you wish, or alter it to your liking. The theme is not final and I will be tweaking it over time.

## Android Studio / IntelliJ

Based from the default Darcula theme, so uses the same background colour as this.

Optimised for Kotlin and Java, but colours also provided for other syntax types. Much of the styling is in the defaults and so would apply to potentially other languages / syntax as well, just not optimised.

- Kotlin
- Java
- Android Logcat
- Groovy / Gradle
- XML / YAML / JSON / HTML / Properties
- .ignore
- General text, comments, TODOs etc.

### Usage

The repository contains both 'LordCodes Syntax.icls' and 'LordCodes Syntax.jar'.

- Open Android Studio
- Navigate to Preferences
- Go to `Editor -> Color Scheme`
- Next to 'Scheme' select the cog and `Import Scheme...`
- Select the LordCodes syntax scheme to import. Either format should work the same.
